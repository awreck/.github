GitHub, sweet GitHub. Ah GitHub, where the world ~builds software~ writes stories. That's right, in the most peculiar cameos of all time, we're writing stories on GitHub.

Who needs Google Docs, or even worse, Microsoft Word? GitHub here has all the tools needed to make collaborative writing not only bearable, but *enjoyable*, to some extent. Join us here at A Wreck of Writers, where we struggle to find similarities between prose, poetry, and code.

# Getting Started ðŸ§±
You can get started either by choosing a project to contribute to. The good news is that anybody can contribute to our projects!

> **Warning**
> The fact that AWoW projects are on GitHub does not mean that they are open source. Each AWoW project has its own License, and that license dictates what fair use is *for that particular project*. If you need more information on licensing or fair use, please use the License issue template to create an issue *on that repository*.

If you want to start your own writing project on AWoW, or if you want to help maintain AWoW projects as a moderator, please create [an issue](https://github.com/awreck/.github/issues/new/choose) to request additional permissions (we will add you to the GitHub org if approved).

# Why GitHub ðŸ¤–
Most people will wonder: why *GitHub*? After all, GitHub isn't especially famous among writers. The important thing is: there are no authors who code; only programmers who write. And as programmers, we have an innate urge to automate every single task that can be automated. We look for the most efficient solution in everything, and GitHub, being built for programmers, is exactly that. It is, in our opinion, the single best platform to collaborate, and it is what has worked best so far for collaborative writing. Offering suggestions, discussing ideas, and working simultaneously on a project has never been easier. We have workflows for offering grammatical and spelling suggestions. We have review pipelines that will ensure that everyone on the team is happy with your work before you push to production. We even have provisions for you to display your writing to the public. So what're you waiting for? Pick up your keyboard and start writing; on GitHub...
